## Raspberry PI 3 Printing Application

After I found out about projects like [RepRap](http://reprap.org) which are designed for Arduino MCUs and me having a RasPi with imo at least the same capabilities I started to plan building a 3d printer and this is the necessary software for this.

## Current Development  
_2018-05-07_
- Cleaned up repository
- Initialized basic project structure

## Contributing
Just open a pull request for changes you that you think are necessary.

## Requirements and Installing
Since this project just started, is absolutely dev and I have no exact clue what has to be done and will be done in the closer future, the use for others might be small to non existent at the moment.
